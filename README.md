🚀 Built an AI Agent with Persistent Memory using Agno + OpenRouter 🎯

Today, I explored Agno, an amazing Python framework for building AI agents — and I’m impressed! 💡



💎 Why Agno?

While frameworks like CrewAI and LangGraph are powerful, Agno shines in a few unique ways:



🚦 Simple API – Create a working agent in just a few lines.



🧠 Built-in Memory Management – Store & recall facts about users automatically.



💾 Multiple Storage Backends – SQLite, Postgres, Redis, and more.



🛠 Tool & Function Calling Support – Easily integrate APIs and custom logic.



🌐 Model Flexibility – Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and even local LLMs.



⚡ Fast Iteration – Less boilerplate, more building.



🛠 What I Built

I created an AI Agent with a real memory that:



✅ Remembers facts about you (e.g., your name, preferences, hobbies).



✅ Stores past conversations in SQLite for persistence.



✅ Uses OpenRouter to access Mistral-7B-Instruct — fast and cost-effective.



✅ Supports multiple user sessions (great for multi-user apps).



✅ Automatically extracts topics from chats for quick recall.



⚙️ How It Works

🔹 Memory Layer – Uses Memory + SqliteMemoryDb to persist user facts.

🔹 Session Storage – Keeps full conversation history in SqliteStorage.

🔹 Model – OpenRouter’s mistral-7b-instruct API for high-quality responses.

🔹 User Context – Every message is enriched with past relevant history.



📌 Example Interaction

You: "My name is Nitesh and I love hiking."

Agent: "Nice to meet you, Nitesh! Hiking sounds amazing. Do you have a favorite trail?"



(Later in another session)

You: "Suggest me a weekend activity."

Agent: "How about a hiking trip, since you enjoy it?" ✅ (Memory at work)



💼 Why This Matters in Real Projects

This type of AI agent is perfect for:



Customer support that remembers repeat customers.



Personal assistants with long-term context.



Learning companions that track your progress.



Chatbots for healthcare, finance, or e-commerce with personalization.
